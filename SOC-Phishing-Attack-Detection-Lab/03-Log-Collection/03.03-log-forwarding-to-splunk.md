# Log Forwarding to Splunk

## 1. Overview

In this lab environment, Windows Sysmon logs were centrally collected and analyzed using Splunk Enterprise running on an Ubuntu server.

The log collection architecture:

Windows 10 (Sysmon Installed)
        ↓
Splunk Universal Forwarder
        ↓
Splunk Enterprise (Ubuntu Server)

This configuration enables real-time log forwarding from the Windows endpoint to the SIEM platform.

## 2. Splunk Universal Forwarder Configuration (Windows)

Splunk Universal Forwarder was installed on the Windows machine to collect and forward Sysmon logs.

### 2.1 inputs.conf

Location:
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local\inputs.conf

```ini
[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
index = sysmon
disabled = false

### Explanation:

WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational → Collects Sysmon Operational logs.

index = sysmon → Logs are stored in the "sysmon" index in Splunk.

disabled = false → Log collection is enabled.
