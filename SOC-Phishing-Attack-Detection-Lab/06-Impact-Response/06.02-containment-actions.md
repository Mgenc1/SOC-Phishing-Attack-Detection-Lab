# Containment Actions – Phishing Click Simulation

This document outlines the containment actions performed during the SOC Home Lab phishing simulation. The objective is to limit potential risk and prevent further exposure following the phishing click.

## 1️. Immediate Actions

During the simulation:

* User workstation (`umut`) was isolated from the network for monitoring.
* Outbound connection to attacker lab machine (`192.168.1.106`) blocked via firewall.
* Verified that no payload execution or reverse shell activity occurred.
* Browser processes monitored for any unusual activity.

## 2️. System and Network Containment

| Action              | Details                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network Isolation   | Restricted workstation to internal LAN traffic only              |
| Firewall Block      | Blocked attacker IP `192.168.1.106` on host and network firewall |
| Endpoint Monitoring | Enabled enhanced logging on browser and user processes           |
| SIEM Alerting       | Created temporary alert for unusual outbound HTTP connections    |

## 3️. User Awareness & Communication

* Notified the user of the phishing simulation and advised on safe email practices.
* Provided guidance to report suspicious emails immediately to SOC team.
* Reinforced training on identifying phishing links and unsafe websites.

## 4️. Follow-Up Actions

* Maintain monitoring of the workstation for any delayed effects.
* Review outbound connection logs to ensure all connections to attacker IP are blocked.
* Conduct periodic phishing simulations to strengthen user awareness and SOC readiness.
* Update SOC detection rules based on observed phishing click artifacts (Sysmon Event ID 3).

## 5️. Summary

* Containment was successful: no malicious payload executed.
* Network exposure limited to observed HTTP click traffic.
* User workstation and browser processes fully monitored post-event.
* SOC team confirmed immediate risk mitigated and preventive measures applied.
