# Impact Assessment – Phishing Click Simulation

This document provides an analysis of the impact resulting from the SOC Home Lab phishing simulation. The objective is to assess affected systems, potential risk exposure, and operational impact.

## 1️. Overview

During the phishing simulation:

* A phishing email was delivered via Gophish.
* The user clicked the malicious link.
* No payload execution or reverse shell activity occurred.
* Outbound network connection to the attacker-controlled lab machine was observed (Sysmon Event ID 3).

## 2️. Affected Systems

| System Type      | Hostname   | IP Address     | Impact Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| User Workstation | umut       | 192.168.1.108  | Initiated outbound connection to attacker lab machine |
| Browser Process  | msedge.exe | N/A            | Tracked as the source of network activity             |
| Network Segment  | LAN        | 192.168.1.0/24 | Exposed to outbound HTTP request (lab environment)    |

## 3️. Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** Low – Medium

**Reasoning:**

* User interaction confirmed (phishing link clicked).
* No malware execution, privilege escalation, or lateral movement observed.
* Network artifact recorded (outbound TCP connection).
* Potential exposure is limited to network visibility in lab environment.

**Business/Operational Impact:**

* Minimal in this lab scenario.
* Demonstrates susceptibility to phishing clicks, useful for SOC training.

## 4️. Summary

* Phishing click confirmed via Sysmon Event ID 3.
* No payload execution, reverse shell, or data exfiltration occurred.
* Workstation and browser process are the only impacted assets in the lab environment.
* Overall operational impact is low, but user awareness and monitoring are key mitigation points.
