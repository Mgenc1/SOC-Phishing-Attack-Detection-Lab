# Lessons Learned – Phishing Click Simulation

This document outlines the lessons learned from the SOC Home Lab phishing simulation. The objective is to evaluate response effectiveness, identify gaps, and improve processes to prevent recurrence.

---

1️. Key Takeaways

* User interaction confirmed: phishing link was clicked.
* Sysmon Event ID 3 provided clear detection of network activity.
* No payload execution occurred, highlighting the importance of early detection.
* Containment actions successfully limited potential exposure.

---

2️. Process Improvements

* SOC monitoring rules should be updated to include outbound HTTP traffic from browsers as an early phishing indicator.
* Phishing simulation frequency can be increased to improve user awareness and readiness.
* Documentation and reporting templates help maintain consistent incident response practices.

---

3️. Technical Enhancements

* Enable advanced logging on workstations to capture process creation, network connections, and termination events.
* Integrate automated alerts for unusual outbound traffic to the SOC dashboard.
* Correlate email delivery logs with endpoint network activity for faster detection.

---

4️. User Awareness & Training

* Conduct regular phishing awareness campaigns for all users.
* Provide step-by-step guidance on identifying suspicious emails and URLs.
* Reinforce reporting procedures to SOC for any suspected phishing attempts.

---

5️. Summary

* Phishing simulation demonstrated both strengths and areas for improvement in SOC monitoring and response.
* Early detection through endpoint logging and network correlation is key.
* Continuous training and process refinement will reduce likelihood of successful phishing in real environments.
