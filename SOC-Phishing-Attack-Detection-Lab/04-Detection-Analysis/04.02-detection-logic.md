# Detection Logic – Phishing Click Detection

## Scenario Overview

During the phishing simulation, a user clicked on a malicious link delivered via Gophish.

No payload execution or reverse shell was performed in this lab.
The objective was to detect the initial network artifact generated by the click action.

## Observed Behavior

1. User clicked phishing link.
2. Browser process (msedge.exe) initiated outbound TCP connection.
3. Sysmon generated Event ID 3 (Network Connection Detected).

## Detection Strategy

### Phase 1 – Suspicious Outbound Web Traffic

Monitor for:

- Browser process initiating outbound HTTP/HTTPS
- Connection to unusual or lab attacker IP
- Traffic outside normal baseline

---

## SOC Investigation Steps

1. Identify EventCode=3 logs
2. Filter for browser processes
3. Investigate Destination IP reputation
4. Correlate timestamp with phishing email delivery time

## Detection Outcome

The phishing click was successfully identified via Sysmon Event ID 3 in Splunk.
