# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping – Phishing Click Simulation

This document maps the observed attack behavior in the SOC phishing lab to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The purpose of this mapping is to demonstrate analytical capability and detection alignment with industry-standard threat models.

---

## Scenario Summary

During the lab simulation:

- A phishing email was delivered via Gophish.
- The user clicked the malicious link.
- The browser initiated an outbound HTTP connection.
- Sysmon generated Event ID 3 (Network Connection).

No payload execution or post-exploitation activity occurred.

# ATT&CK Technique Mapping

## 1️. Initial Access

### T1566 – Phishing

**Technique:**  
T1566.002 – Phishing: Spearphishing Link

**Why This Applies:**

- The user received a phishing email.
- The email contained a malicious link.
- The user clicked the link, initiating network communication.

**Observed Evidence:**

- Phishing URL: `http://192.168.1.106/?rid=TWUdkmw`
- Browser-initiated outbound connection
- Sysmon EventCode 3

---

## 2️. Command and Control (Simulated Stage)

### T1071 – Application Layer Protocol

**Technique:**  
T1071.001 – Web Protocols

**Why This Applies:**

- The browser initiated outbound HTTP communication.
- Port 80 was used for communication with the attacker machine.

Even though no reverse shell or payload execution occurred, outbound web communication to attacker infrastructure simulates early-stage C2 behavior.

**Observed Evidence:**

- Destination IP: 192.168.1.106
- Destination Port: 80
- Protocol: TCP
- Process: msedge.exe

# ATT&CK Tactical Overview

| Tactic             | Technique ID | Technique Name              | Observed |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Initial Access     | T1566.002   | Spearphishing Link         | Yes      |
| Command & Control  | T1071.001   | Web Protocols              | Simulated |

# Detection Alignment

The detection logic implemented in Splunk aligns with:

- Monitoring browser outbound connections
- Detecting suspicious HTTP traffic
- Identifying communication with attacker-controlled IP

Primary Detection Artifact:
- Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connection)

# Analyst Notes

This lab demonstrates detection capability at the Initial Access stage of the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain.

Since no payload execution occurred, Execution (TA0002), Persistence (TA0003), or Lateral Movement (TA0008) techniques were not observed.

The focus of this simulation was early-stage phishing detection and network artifact analysis.
